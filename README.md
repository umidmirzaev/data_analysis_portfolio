# Umid Mirzaev - Data Engineering & Analysis Portfolio

## About
Hi, I'm Umid!
I hold a Bachelor's degree in Petroleum Engineering and a Master's degree (M.S.) in Petroleum Logistics from Molde University College in Norway, where I specialized in Mathematical Modeling and Data Analysis. Over the past three years, I've gained experience in IT, working as a Data Analyst, Database Administrator, and Infrastructure Engineer at consulting firms.

This repository serves as a platform to showcase my skills, share my data analysis projects, and track my progress in Data Analytics and Data Engineering-related topics.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I list data engineering & analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Cohort  Analysis
**Code:** [Cohort Analysis]  
**Description:** This project analyzes transactional data from a homebrewing and craft brewing supply store using cohort analysis. The goal is to track and understand user behavior over time, identifying trends and patterns.  
**Skills:** Data cleaning, data analysis, hypothesis testing, data visualization.  
**Technology:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib.  
**Results:** Cohort retention and revenue trends were found and analyzed.


### Marketing Data Analysis
**Code:** [Marketing Data Analysis](https://github.com/umidmirzaev/data_analysis_portfolio/blob/main/Marketing%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb)  
**Description:** The main dataset contains 19360 records related to synthetic marketing data that simulates campaign performance across various states. The dataset records key metrics such as total touchpoints, state-specific responses (both web and phone), and conversion outcomes over a defined time period. Additional information on each campaign includes costs and identifiers, offering insights into marketing efforts and resource allocation.  
**Skills:** Data cleaning, data analysis, hypothesis testing, data visualization.  
**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib.  
**Results:** Review of the marketing campaign performance across various states.

### Player Performance and Market Value Analysis
**Code:** [Player Performance]   
**Description:** Exploring key metrics of football players, focusing on their performance, potential, and market values.   
**Skills:** Data cleaning, data analysis, hypothesis testing, data visualization.  
**Technology:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib.  
**Results:** The results show that players with higher ratings have greater potential, market values peak between ages 22-33, and attackers command higher market values than defenders and goalkeepers..
