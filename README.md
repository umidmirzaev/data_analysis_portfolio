# Umid Mirzaev - Data Analysis Portfolio

## About
Hi, I'm Umid!
I hold a Bachelor's degree in Petroleum Engineering and a Master's degree (M.S.) in Petroleum Logistics from Molde University College in Norway, where I specialized in Mathematical Modeling and Analysis. Over the past three years, I've gained experience in IT, working as a Data Analyst, Database Administrator, and Infrastructure Engineer at consulting firms.

This repository serves as a platform to showcase my skills, share my data analysis projects, and track my progress in Data Analytics and Data Science-related topics.
